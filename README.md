# Skin Cancer Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

* Created a deep learning model designed to classify skin moles as benign or malignant melanoma using images as input
* The data set included 3297 images, 1800 were images of benign skin moles and 1497 were of malignant skin moles
* Within Python, Pytorch was utilized in order to create both a fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network
* Performance evaluation indicated that a convolutional neural network would be the superior option
* The CNN model achieved a test accuracy of  percent
